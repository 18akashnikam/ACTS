Questions:


Ques 1 -> Unique  Subsequence 

You are given a string a....z  You have to generate the set (all unique) of all the substrings of X and then sort that set lexicographically. Now to have to tell the rank of the string X in the new set formed.

Note: String X contains only lowercase English letters. and it should contain all alphabets

eg : “eren”

Lexicograhically Sorted set of unique substrings of X = {“e”, “en”, “er”, “ere”, “eren”, “n”, “r”, “re”, “ren”}

Rank of “eren” = 5

Note: Time complexity matters, optimize your algorithm

 

Ques 2 -> Walls

Consider N walls, each of unit width, situated next to each other.

You have to select any two walls i and j (1<=i, j<=N) such that if you break all walls except i and j and fill the spaces between them with water, then the amount of water stored is maximum.

Write a program to find the maximum amount of water that can be accumulated between the walls.

eg: 1 2 3 4 5

Ans: we choose wall 2 and 5, the amount of water that can be stored will be the distance between walls i.e (5-2-1) = 4 which is maximum.


Ques 3 -> Travelling Postman

 You have to travel all cities but one different things postman forget to deliver post at one place (provided in input) so at last visit that location
 and then go to origin
